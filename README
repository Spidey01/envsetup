ENVSETUP
--------

For one of my projects I decided to make a top level helper script, similar to
how the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) exports functions for develoeprs.
Eventually I decided this should be more general and made this git, so I can
easily make new projects with it :-).

This is intended for projects written in C, C++, or Java. It is meant to be run
form the command line on a Unix or Windows NT based system. Bash and cmd.exe
are supported as shells.

It does not have to be an Android project. It can be anything.


YOUR PROJECT
============

Add envsetup as a submodule of the same name to your Git. Or just download from git an extract the same way.

        envsetup\
                .cmd
                envsetup.sh
                envsetup.cmd


At present the following build tools are supported:

        make
        gradle

You may wish to include these in your .gitignore or equivalent:

        envsetup.local.sh
        envsetup.local.cmd


To get stuff going in your development shell: source the .sh in bash or run the
.cmd in cmd.exe.

	$ . ./envsetup/envsetup.sh

	E:\proj> .\envsetup\envsetup.cmd

Create envsetup.project.{sh,cmd} files with project local stuff you want to share among developers.

Edit the created envsetup.local.{sh,cmd} files with local stuff for your tree.


On Windows you may place executable files and stuff in %PROJECT_ROOT%\.cmd; it
will be injected into your %Path% along with envsetup\.cmd.

On UNIX based systems, well you know how to write shell functions don't you?
There is also the ./.cmd directory if you wish to add that to your $PATH via
envsetup.local.sh.
