ENVSETUP
--------

For one of my projects I decided to make a top level helper script, similar to
how the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) exports functions for develoeprs.
Eventually I decided this should be more general and made this git, so I can
easily make new projects with it :-).

This is intended for projects written in C, C++, or Java. It is meant to be run
form the command line on a Unix or Windows NT based system. Bash and cmd.exe
are supported as shells.

It does not have to be an Android project. It can be anything.


YOUR PROJECT
============

Copy over the following to your project root:

	.cmd
	envsetup.sh
	envsetup.cmd

Create the following files or edit the script accordingly:

	COPYING
	README

And your build system, etc. Several are kinda supported. Patches welcome.

You may wish to include the contents of my .gitignore in this repo.


To get stuff going in your development shell: source the .sh in bash or run the
.cmd in cmd.exe.

	$ . ./envsetup.sh

	E:\proj> envsetup.cmd

Edit the created envsetup.local.{sh,cmd} files with project local stuff.

On Windows you may place local batch files and stuff in .\.cmd and prefix the
extnesion with .local. E.g. foo.local.cmd. This directory gets added to your
%Path%.

On UNIX based systems, well you know how to write shell functions don't you?
There is also the ./.cmd directory if you wish to add that to your $PATH via
envsetup.local.sh.
