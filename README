ENVSETUP
--------

For one of my projects I decided to make a top level helper script, similar to
how the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) functions. Eventually I decided this
should be more general and made this git, so I can easily make new projects
with it :-).

YOUR PROJECT
============

Copy over the following to your project root:

	envsetup.sh
	envsetup.cmd

Create the following files or edit the script accordingly:

	COPYING
	README

And your build system, etc. Several are kinda supported. Patches welcome.

To get stuff going, source the .sh in bash or run the .cmd in cmd.exe.

	$ . ./envsetup.sh

	E:\proj> envsetup.cmd

Edit the created envsetup.local.{sh,cmd} files with project local stuff.
